## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) I would offer AI to be customizable like how Apple's Siri you are able to change voice. I think having AI learn how people would prefer to bank.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
  Not everyone is wanting to switch to another bank. Retaining a customer could be achieved and incentivize any young people in need of a bank account to come to Wells Fargo. Where everything could be curated to its user.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
  It would use data centers and also teams of people learning how to use the data and come up with other services in order to sell to customers.
  
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
  They are appropriate because everyone in the field is using it to their advantage.
